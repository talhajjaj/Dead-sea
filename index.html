      <h3> why its called dead sea? </h3>
      <p>The sea is called "dead" because its high salinity prevents aquatic organisms, such as fish and aquatic plants, from living in it, so there's nothing live in it .</p>

      <h3>-Features of the Dead Sea:   </h3>
      <p>The Dead Sea is famous for being the lowest point on Earth's surface, with its shoreline reaching 400 meters below sea level.
      The Dead Sea is also characterized by its strong salinity, where the percentage of salts in it is about 34%, which is nine times the concentration of salts in the Mediterranean, and one of the highest levels of salinity in water bodies in the world.</p>
